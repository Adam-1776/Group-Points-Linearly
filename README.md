# Finding the maximum number of points that are collinear using a bruteforce approach

**Requirements**:
* Any C++ compiler <br>

**Compilation**: 
* Download the files in this repository, and open its containing folder
* Use your terminal to compile *lines.cpp* using `g++ lines.cpp`

**Execution**:
* The input method is a text file that contains the coordinates to be tested.
* The first line of this text file is an integer *n*, the number of points.
* The next *n* lines contain two integers, one for the x-coordinate, and the other the y-coordinate
* See sample input files in this repository for examples.
* During execution, specify this input file as the commandline argument. 
* Example: `./a.exe data.txt`
